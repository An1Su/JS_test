# mockCheckpoint

Similar to the mockCheckpoint for go, this is for js...

In the repo, the questions are split into 7 folders base the group the question is assigned to.

Each question folder, should have a [subject].md for the question and restrictions.
There is also an empty [subject].js file for your answer.

**REMEMBER: you need to export your function so that the tester can grab it for testing!**

Each question should have a working test file.
You can run `node [subject]_test.js` to check your answers against the testcases.
You will have to impose you own restriction as the test files do not check packages used.

There might still be some issues with the test files. Do approach me, if you thing that something isn't working properly.

## Tips
- Right click on README.md and select `Open Preview` to get a pleasant viewing experience.
- Right click on the question folder and select `Open In Intergrated Terminal`. This will open a separate terminal tab at that directory (so, you don't have to navigate to the folder)
