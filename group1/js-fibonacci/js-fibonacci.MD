# fibonacci
## Instructions
Write a function that takes an integer n as an argument and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

## Expected function
`function fibonacci(n) {}`

## Usage
Here is a possible program to test your function:

```
console.log(fibonacci(6));
console.log(fibonacci(10));
```

And its output:

```
$ node main.js
